Build a web app that allow the user to simulate synthetic car trips data for a generic driver.

The input should be the address of the user, and there should be a button to simulate a trip and display it on a map.

Each trip simulation is based of a nearby destination chosen randomly and it is assumed that driver come back home after each destinations.

Synthetic data should include location og arch breackin, accelerations and speeding evnets, indicated on the trip map with corresponding pictograms
